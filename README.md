# TanobbIRC
An IRC bot based on Tanobb, the Auto-Translating Imageboard https://www.tanobb.com/

## How it works
The bot sits in 13 channels, one for each language. Users enter the channel for the language they want to post in. The bot takes post text and runs it through the Transltr http://www.transltr.org/ API, and sends it to the other 12 channels, along with the name of the poster. Transltr is used currently, becuase it is free. The program can be changed to use the Bing or Google API.
