# TanobbIRC
An IRC bot based on Tanobb, the Auto-Translating Imageboard https://www.tanobb.com/

# How it works
The bot sits in 13 channels, one for each language.
Users enter the channel for the language they want to post in, and speak.
The bot takes post text and runs it through the Google or Bing translate API, and sends it to the other 12 channels, along with the name of the poster.
